Description: Self-configuring BGP monitoring tool, which allows you to monitor in real-time if:
    any of your prefixes loses visibility;
    any of your prefixes is hijacked;
    your AS is announcing RPKI invalid prefixes (e.g., not matching prefix length);
    your AS is announcing prefixes not covered by ROAs;
    any of your ROAs is expiring;
    ROAs covering your prefixes are no longer reachable;
    RPKI Trust Anchors malfunctions;
    a ROA involving any of your prefixes or ASes was deleted/added/edited;
    your AS is announcing a new prefix that was never announced before;
    an unexpected upstream (left-side) AS appears in an AS path;
    an unexpected downstream (right-side) AS appears in an AS path;
    one of the AS paths used to reach your prefix matches a specific condition defined by you.
